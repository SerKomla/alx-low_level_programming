Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at **ALx School.** It aims to learn about arithmetic operators, relational operators, boolean operators, comments, declaring variables and loops in **C language.*

*Technologies*

    C files are compiled using *gcc 9.4.0*
    Tested on Ubuntu 20.04

Here are a list of the files and thier description.

1. 0-positive_or_negative.c: This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

2. 1-last_digit.c: This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

3. 2-print_alphabet.c: This is a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

4. 3-print_alphabets.c: This is a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

5. 4-print_alphabt.c: This is a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

6. 5-print_numbers.c: This is a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

7. 6-print_numberz.c: This program prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

8. 7-print_tebahpla.c: a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.

9. 8-print_base16.c: a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.

10. 9-print_comb.c: a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.

11. 100-print_comb3.c: a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

12. 101-print_comb4.c: a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.

13. 102-print_comb5.c: a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
